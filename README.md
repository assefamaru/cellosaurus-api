This is an unofficial API for the [`Cellosaurus`](https://www.cellosaurus.org),
written at a time when Cellosaurus lacked a proper API. This is now obsolete. As
of Sept 20, 2022, Cellosaurus has released an
[official API](https://api.cellosaurus.org).

Old documentation is still available in [`docs/archived.md`](/docs/archived.md)
for posterity.
