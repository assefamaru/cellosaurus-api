# cellosaurus-api

This is an unofficial API for the Cellosaurus, developed at a time when Cellosaurus did not have an official API. This is now obsolete.

As of September 20, 2022, Cellosaurus has released an official API, which can be accessed at [api.cellosaurus.org](https://api.cellosaurus.org). It not only supports everything in this repo, but also provides more powerful search criteria, and more control over output and formats. Therefore, this repo has become obsolete and will no longer be maintained.

The live APIs serving this repo will get discontinued starting January 2023. For users currently using this API, please migrate to the official API at your earliest convenience.

Old README docs will be available inside [`docs/archived.md`](/docs/archived.md).
